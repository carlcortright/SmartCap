# SmartCap
Smart hat concept with Intel Edison and Android connectivity. 

Ever googled "wearables" lately? Almost every wearable to date has been a watch. We are about to change that with SmartCap 1.0, the world's first open source smart hat. The idea behind this project is to show how wearables worn not just on the wrist can enhance our subjective experience by connecting us directly to the internet of things.
